## Purpose


## What I Learned
- Methods for manipulating DOM elements based upon user input
- Using `eventListener` and `getElementbyId`
- Dynamically creating and styling DOM elements
- How to use `querySelector` to interact with the DOM
- Benefit of incorporating incremental `console.log` checks

## Further Development Ideas
